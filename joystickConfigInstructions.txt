***This document provides the instructions for configuring a (gaming) controller to ROS using joy_node and reading axis and button inputs from the controller.****

***Disclaimer - The controller that was used was the Logitech F318 model and the Indigo Distribution of ROS was used.***

**INSTALLING JOY_NODE AND CONFIGURING LOGITECH F318 CONTROLLER WITH ARDRONE**
************************************************************************************************************************************************Reference: wiki.ros.org/joy/Tutorials/ConfiguringALinuxJoystick

Note: Make sure that on the back of this particular controller (or similar builds) that the switch is in the 'X' position.

1) Install the package ros-joy:
	sudo apt-get install ros-*USER'S DISTRIBUTION of ROS*-joy

2) Now we must see if Linux recognizes the controller after connecting it to the computer through the USB port:
	ls /dev/input/

3) After typing in the previous command, you should see a tabular output of the various input devices that Linux currently recognizes. Look for an entry that says js'X' where 'X' is some integer value. 
	(If the controller is the only device connected via USB to the computer, then the entry should say "js0")

4) Now check that the joystick and its interface is working properly. Make sure that jstest is installed:
	sudo jstest /dev/input/js'X'
The resulting output should be large and lists the conditions of the buttons and axes.

5) Now we must make the joystick accessible to ROS, but we must first list the permissions:
	ls -l /dev/input/js'X'
The output of this command should be: 
	crw -rw -'XX' - 1 root dialout 188, 0 'Date & Time' /dev/input/js'X'

The 'XX' are just placeholders:
	If 'XX' = 'rw' then the device is configured properly. Skip to step 7.
	If 'XX' = '--' then the device still needs to be configured correctly. 

6) Type in the following:
	sudo chmod a+rw /dev/input/js'X'

7) Now we will start joy_node and double check that everything works

8) To get the joystick data published to ROS you have to start the joy_node node:
	rosparam set joy_node/dev "dev/input/js'X'"

9) Now run the joy_node node and a large output should result:
	rosrun joy joy_node
If the buttons or axes are moved then the output screen should update as each new state of each button or axis is printed.
This means that the device is properly configured.
